# Cryptography Project
<p>
  This project was created for my Linear Algebra course that I took during the Fall 2024 Semester. This project not only gave me a deeper understanding of cryptography and the implications of it, but also taught me better coordination and cooperation skills with my team. Our team used Python to create this project, which involved the use of the numpy library in order to carry out the matrix calculations that were needed.
